My translation of the code from the [Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/) book.

## Notes
1. I decied to skip translating the flask.Flash() function. While nice, I deemed it a distraction from my goal of learnign htmx.
2. The book implemented three forms of data partitioning(?) in the table. Paging, Click To Load, and Infinite Scrolling. Paging, Click To Load, and Infinite Scrolling have
thier own branches. Infinite scrolling was last implemented and it was messing with the active search, and I'm not sure how to make them work togehter. Plus infinite scroll is funky in this
contacts example.
