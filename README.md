My translation of the code from the [Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/) book.

## Notes
1. I decied to skip translating the flask.Flash() function. While nice, I deemed it a distraction from my goal of learnign htmx.
2. The book implemented three forms of data partitioning(?) in the table. Paging, Click To Load, and Infinite Scrolling. Paging and Click To Load have
thier own branches. Infinite Scrolling is on master.
